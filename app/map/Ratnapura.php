					      	Adam’s Peak stands at an altitude of 7,360 feet and is the most remarkable mountain and a depression in the summit looks like a big footprint. Since ancient times this footprint has been considered sacred by Buddhist, Hindus and Muslims.
Adam’s Peak attracts pilgrims from all parts of the country as well as foreign tourists. The aim of every pilgrim is to ascend to the peak before sunrise in order that they could enjoy watching the beauty of sunrise. Having watched this beautiful scene they perform their religious rites. It is a difficult task to climb and takes several hours to reach the summit. Resting places are provided at different points on the path for the pilgrims to rest and partake their meals. The devotees usually have their ceremonial bath of cleansing and put on new clothes. They then cross over a bridge from the river which separates the peak from the surrounding mountains. From here onwards the climb is difficult. The pilgrims have to use a series of very steep steps. However, railings have been fixed to support the climbers.
Sri Pada can be accessed through Malwala, Kuruvita, Erama, Gili Male and Palabaddala. From Palabaddala the path runs through various hills, deep valleys and is infested with leeches.
