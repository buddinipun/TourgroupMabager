					   The Jathika Namal Uyana lies in the dry zone, about 159 Km. from Colombo along the Dambulla-Anuradhapura road. It is 7 Km. to the west of Madatugama junction. Archaeological ruins, pink quartz deposits are found here. It was a habitat for several animal and plant species.
Jathika Nmal Uyana is unique in the sense it is supposed to be the oldest man made forest in Sri Lanka. In the 8th century AD King Dappula set up this forest of 238 acre extent and planted with Iron wood trees. It is a home for a variety of animal, bird and plant life. Rare species of lizards and medicinal plants are also found here. The seven summits of Pink Quartz mountain formed 550 million years ago tower above the forest. The mountain stands at a height of about 665 mt. It is considered as the largest concentration of pink quartz in Southeast Asia and the only one found in this country.
As far back as the first century AD and during the reign of King Devanampiyatissa Namal Uyana had been used as a monastery. But during the reign of King Depulu IV by the eighth century it had been transformed as a sanctuary and acted as a refugee centre for people who fled from persecution. The existence of Namal Uyana and the sanctuary have been confirmed by several stone inscriptions in the Anuradhapura area.  These details also appear in one of the two octagonal stone inscription. The Ceylon Tourist Board has initiated the construction of a conservation centre for the protection of Namal Uyana. This will help the visitors to climb the pink quartz mountain as well as meet the villagers living around the Uyana. The guides for the visitors would be provided from the village and Ulpothagama.

					      	Dambulla Rock Temple is considered as the most impressive cave temple in Sri Lanka. It dates back to the 1st century B.C. It consists of five caves under a overhanging rock. To keep the interiors of the caves dry it is carved with a drip line. The ceilings are adorned with paintings of religious images and various gods and goddesses. Images of Buddha and bodhisattvas are also found here. The caves in the temple have been converted into shrine rooms. The caves stand on 150 mt. high rock and they were built during the periods of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Kingdoms. This famous temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Dambulla cave is considered as the best-preserved edifice in Sri Lanka.<br><br>
Of the five caves, the first cave is called Devarajalena and is also known as the Cave of the Divine King. The founding of the cave is recorded by the first century Brahmi inscription over the entrance to the first cave. In the second cave, which is the largest cave, there are sixteen standing and forty seated statues of Buddha. There is also the statues of God Saman and Vishnu. The other notable statues are of King Vatta Gamini and King Nissanka Malla found in ‘Maharajalena’ cave. ‘Maha Aluth Viharaya’ (Great New Monastry) is the third cave. A statue of King Keerthi Sri Rajasingha who ruled Kandy from 1747 – 1781. The other two caves are small and not very significiant.<br><br>

					      	Sigiriya is located in the North Central part of Sri Lanka and preserves the architectural tradition of the country. It is about 169 Kms. from Colombo and lies between Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. It is within the cultural triangle which includes five of the seven world heritage sites in Sri Lanka. History of the town dates back to more than 7000 years. The town is renowned for its Rock Garden and Sanctuary. Sigiriya rock remained as a Royal Citadel for nearly twenty years. This rock fortress was built by King Kashiyapa. This amazing fortress is in the shape of a lion. It is a world heritage and has gained popularity throughout the world by the frescoes on its rock wall and highly developed water system. The rock of Sigiriya is also known as the Lion’s Rock.<br>
Visitors access the palace through a stone staircase that takes them to the lion’s mouth and through it’s throat. However only two massive paws and brick masonry remain now. The paws gives us an idea how gigantic the rest of the structure must have been. An advanced pumping system had been used to fill the two tanks which were used for bathing and drinking. The water had been pumped from a lake at the foot of the rock.<br><br>
A Hand Craft village has been established under the Ministry of Rural Economic Development. Villagers who are engaged in wood craft, brass work, clay work, leather work, reed work and other allied handicrafts have set up stalls there to exhibit and sell their products. There is also an open stage to conduct cultural shows and also a museum run by the National Design Centre. For the benefit of foreign tourists facilities such as Foreign Currency Exchange, Internet Café and Tourist Information Centre have been set up.<br>
